Welcome to my attempt to document the history of the Bunbury Radio Club.

My name is Phil and my amateur radio call sign is VK6DEV.

I welcome you input/additions/corrections. Please email me [vk6dev@gmail.com](mailto:vk6dev@gmail.com)

## Introduction

When I first joined the Bunbury Radio Club in 2022, I was struck but the amount of history about the club that was held in the heads of the current members. I looked for any written history about the club and found very little available.

Since taking on the role of President in 2023, I have become the custodian on the club records. This has given me access to many documents which outline the history of our club over the past 50ish years.

Over time I will record and document the records I have.

## Bunbury And Districts UHF Repeater Group

I found this in a magazine article. First I had heard of the repeater group. I have added a page to the site to capture any further information I may come across. [Link](bunburyanddistrictsuhfgroup.md)

Welcome to my attempt to document the history of the Bunbury Radio Club.

My name is Phil and my amateur radio call sign is VK6DEV.

I welcome you input/additions/corrections. Please email me [vk6dev@gmail.com](mailto:vk6dev@gmail.com)

The Bunbury Radio Club was founded in 1977. The date I am setting as the official date is 12 March 1977, which is the earliest reference I could find to a meeting which led to the establishment of the "Bunbury CB Radio Club". ([Ref](./docs/media/From%20the%20archives-club%20founding.pdf))

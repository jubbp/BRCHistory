Welcome to my attempt to document the history of the Bunbury Radio Club.

My name is Phil and my amateur radio call sign is VK6DEV.

I welcome you input/additions/corrections. Please email me [vk6dev@gmail.com](mailto:vk6dev@gmail.com)

## Introduction

When I first joined the Bunbury Radio Club in 2022, I was struck but the amount of history about the club that was held in the heads of the current members. I looked for any written history about the club and found very little available.

Since taking on the role of President in 2023, I have become the custodian on the club records. This has given me access to many documents which outline the history of our club over the almost 50 years of its existance.

Over time I will record and document the records I have.
